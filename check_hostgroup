# This check checks the overall state of a host group. 
# It fetches the current state of all hosts of a group
# via livestatus (the path to the livestatus socket is
# provided as a third, optional parameter).
# 
# Provide the name of the host group as first
# parameter.
#
# If you specify a number NUM as second parameter,
# then the state of this check is not considered to
# be the worst host state of the group but the
# NUM'th worst state. E.g. if there is one critical
# and one warning host, then specifying 2 will
# result in a warning state and 3 in a OK state.
#
# WARN is considered to be worse than UNKNOWN.
